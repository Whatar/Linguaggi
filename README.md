This project contains a few different interpreters built with Java and HAML4.

This interpreters were built for a course at (univr)[https://www.corsi.univr.it/?ent=cs&id=420]

The final project, and the most interesting one, is documented here.

# (Have Fun)[https://github.com/Whatar/Linguaggi/tree/master/HaveFun]

This interpreter was invented for a simple language similar to python, with support for the following functionalities:

- Functions
- Variables
- Global variables
- different scopes
- recursive functions and scopes
- mutually recursive functions and scopes
- different nested languages (The interpreter supports the use of the fictional "CHUCK NORRIS" programming language inside braces).
